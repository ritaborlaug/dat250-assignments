I didn't have any issues with the installing of the Postman tool, and the execution of the HTTP requests went well. I spent some time trying to figure out how I could make a collection of the requests, but once I figured that out it was no problem to execute the requests.

I didn't encounter any problems when I implemented the REST API for the Todo-items.
