For this assignment I have worked together with Sunniva Lothe.

Link to my code: 

Angular project:

Made some small changes in ex4 code:

I have struggled quite a bit to understand the angular framework. I have tried my best to implement as much as possible, but I am aware that the project structure probably could have been structured better.

Currently I am able to add new todos to the list, but I am not able to delete them. I did not manage to resolve this problem, even though I really tried.
